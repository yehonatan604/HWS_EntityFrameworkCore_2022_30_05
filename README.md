Create an app than deals with al least one entity using EF and SQL SERVER.
The app is a Console App and it presents different options to the user.
As the app start the user can:
    1. Create an Entity.
    2. Delete an Entity.
    3. Update an Entity.
    4. Get Entity Details.
    5. Get the List of entities.
    6. Quit the app
If the user select option 6 the app is exited (breaks out the loop), else, the user is being asked what he want to do (again) after the following relevant operation are executed:
    • For option 1
        ◦ The app ask the user for details about the data to create the entity (for example: if the entity is a Student (our Class from the lesson) the app will create a student with the name provided via user input – console.readline), and create it in the DB
    • For option 2
        ◦ The app will ask the user for the Id of the entity the user want to delete and delete that entity from the DB using the context
    • For option 3
        ◦ The app will ask for details about the Entity to update (id of the entity and new data for the entity fields)
        ◦ Detailed about how to update an entity you can find here:

    • For option 4
        ◦ The app asks the user for the id of the entity and print the object (you can use any format of presentation as you want)
    • For option 5
        ◦ Same as 4 but no id is needed the app just print all the data for all the entities
